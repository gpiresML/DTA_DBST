# BCI-Self-paced Multi-session Dataset 

This dataset was created to test the combination of self-paced control with “One-Time Calibration” (user specific, but session-independent models):
- The multi-session dataset is available in the dataset directory
- Read **Instructions_data.pdf** file for explanation regarding LSC communication speller paradigm and how to extract data from datasets
- Run the main file xxxxxx.m  to extract EEG epochs from datasets
- A  demonstratative video of the self-paced communication-speller BCI is available below
